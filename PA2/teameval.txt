		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Sarah Yang

 
B: Jensen Chang

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	2		2
coding 	  	  	 	10		10
writeup 	  	  	5		8
planning (alone) 	  	10		10
total (including meetings) 	27 	  	30


(3) Describe 
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
	A: 2D tiling implementation and optimization, report writeup
	B: basic shared memory implementation, 2D tiling optimization, report writeup
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
	Completed.
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
	Both of us think about approaches to optimize. Busy during midterm, but communication is still maintained.
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
	Learned how to utilize GPU resources with CUDA.
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
	We work good together.
  (f) anything else that comes to mind.
	All good!
